### Projects Overview

- **Color Detection** (`Color Detection/`):

  - Detect and classify colors in images using OpenCV.
  - Includes utility functions and a main script for demonstration.

- **Image DC** (`image dc/`):

  - General image processing tools and scripts for various computer vision tasks.

- **Parking iC** (`Parking iC/`):

  - Detects empty and occupied parking spaces using image classification.
  - Includes a pre-trained model and sample parking lot images.

- **Pneumonia iC** (`Pneumonia iC/`):

  - Classifies chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia using deep learning.
  - Contains a trained Keras model and label files.

- **Weather iC** (`Weather iC/`):
  - Classifies weather conditions (cloudy, rain, shine, sunrise) from images.
  - Includes organized datasets for training and validation.

## How to Use

1. Choose a project folder of interest.
2. Review the `main.py` file and any supporting scripts or data.
3. Install required dependencies (see code or add your own `requirements.txt`).
4. Run the project using Python 3.

## Requirements

Most projects require Python 3 and libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, or Keras. Check each folder for specific dependencies.

## Purpose
